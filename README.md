# MNIST Classifier with CI/CD Pipeline

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier for the MNIST dataset with automated testing and CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. The model is designed to be lightweight (<100K parameters) while maintaining high accuracy (>80%) on digit classification.
